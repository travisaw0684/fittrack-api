FitTrack: Fitness Tracking Web Application
FitTrack is a full-stack web application that enables users to track their fitness progress by logging workouts, selecting pre-designed routines, and creating customizable workout plans. Built with a PHP REST API for the backend and a WordPress frontend with a custom theme and plugin, FitTrack showcases a seamless integration of secure API-driven functionality with a user-friendly CMS interface.

This project demonstrates my skills in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, WordPress development, and REST API design, with a focus on delivering a practical, fitness-focused solution.
